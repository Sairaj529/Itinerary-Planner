Itinerary-Planner
===
Welcome to the Itinerary-Planner repository! This project provides an easy-to-use Python application that calculates the shortest route from a starting point to various nearby points of interest. It leverages the A* algorithm and Bing Maps API to deliver efficient and accurate routing.

Features
---
Shortest Route Calculation: Determines the shortest path from a given start point to multiple points of interest.
A Algorithm*: Utilizes the A* search algorithm for optimal pathfinding.
Bing Maps API Integration: Integrates with the Bing Maps API to fetch real-time map data and locations.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for easy interaction and input.
How It Works

Core Components
---
A Algorithm*: The project employs the A* search algorithm, known for its efficiency and accuracy in pathfinding problems. The heuristic used ensures that the shortest and most optimal path is found.
Bing Maps API: This API is used to retrieve map data, including distances and routes between points of interest. The API enhances the application's accuracy by providing real-time data.
